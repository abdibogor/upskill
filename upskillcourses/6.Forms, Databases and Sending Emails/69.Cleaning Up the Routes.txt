Ruby rails

The Rails Guides web page for routing is a great way to dive deeper into how URLs and HTTP work in a Rails web app.

The resources :contacts line of code in the routes file is overkill.

We can simplify it by adding a bit of code to it.

This way, our site only uses the URLs and routes that we need.

Even though there are 4 main HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and 4 corresponding REST actions Read, Create, Update, Delete, Rails allows us to do 7 things with our resources (most of them are additional variations of GET/Read).

###config/routes.rb
...

resources :contacts, only: :create

get 'contact-us', to: 'contacts#new', as: 'new_contact'

...

###Terminal


git status

git add .

git commit -m "Cleaned up contact form routes"

git push origin contact_form
