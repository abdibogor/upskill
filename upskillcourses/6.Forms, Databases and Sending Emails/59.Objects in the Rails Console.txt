We'll use a powerful tool that comes with Rails called the console.

We'll also see what objects look like in Rails and how to save them.

Then, we'll learn how to view saved database records.

###Terminal


rails console --sandbox

> Contact.new

> @contact = Contact.new

> @contact.name = "John Doe"

> @contact.email = "john@example.com"

> @contact

> @contact.name

> @contact.save

> Contact.first

> Contact.all

> exit
