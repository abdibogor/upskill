Validations are useful for controlling or limiting what gets saved from a form to a database.
We'll add validations to ensure each form field has input.

###app/models/contact.rb


class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
  
validates :name, presence: true
 
 validates :email, presence: true
  
validates :comments, presence: true

end

###Terminal


git add .

git commit -m "Added form validations to model"

git push origin contact_form
