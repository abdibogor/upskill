We should deploy a copy of our site to Heroku, before configuring the server to also send emails.

We need to merge our code from the contact_form branch into our master branch first.

###Terminal

git checkout master

git branch

git merge contact_form

git push origin master

git push heroku master

heroku run rails db:migrate
