We'll reach a milestone by learning how to save forms to a database, programatically.
We'll also add a Rails flash notice to our layout file.
Then, we'll use the rails console command to view what is inside our database.

###app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb
...
def new
  @contact = Contact.new
end
def create
  @contact = Contact.new(contact_params)
  if @contact.save
     redirect_to new_contact_path, notice: "Message sent."
  else
     redirect_to new_contact_path, notice: "Error occured."
  end
end
private
  def contact_params
     params.require(:contact).permit(:name, :email, :comments)
  end
...

###app/views/contacts/new.html.erb
...
<%= flash[:notice] %>
...

To view what is inside our database...

###Terminal


rails console

> Contact.all

> exit

Then wrap up by saving and deploying a Git commit.
###Terminal

git status

git add .

git commit -m "Added contact create action to save to db"

git push origin contact_form
