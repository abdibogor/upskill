We'll create a model file for our contact form.

The model file is for creating a blueprint for our contact form objects.

This is our first taste of how object-oriented programming works in Rails.

###Terminal


touch app/models/contact.rb

###app/models/contact.rb


class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base

end

###Terminal
git status

git add .

git commit -m "Added contact model file"

git push origin contact_form
