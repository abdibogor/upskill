bootstrap Alert


We'll rewrite the flash display inside an Each loop.

The Each loop, when used with flash, allows us to use two temporary variables - 
we'll call them 'type' and 'msg', since we can name them whatever we want.
We'll output a div using the Rails content_tag function inside the loop.

By doing all of this, we have a dynamically generated flash message with dynamically generated CSS classes applied.

Dynamic is a buzzword used to say the content was computed instead of hard-coded by hand.

####app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

...

<% flash.each do |type, msg| %>
 
 <%= content_tag :div, msg, class: "alert alert-#{type}" %>

<% end %>

...

###app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb
...

flash[:danger] = @contact.errors.full_messages.join(", ")

...

###Terminal
git status

git add .

git commit -m "Improved flash style"

git push origin contact_form
