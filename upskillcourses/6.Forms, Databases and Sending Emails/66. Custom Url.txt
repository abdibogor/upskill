We can create custom URLs in the routes file with ease.

The key takeaway is that you should point the custom path name to the appropriate controller and action.

###config/routes.rb
...

get 'contact-us', to: 'contacts#new'

...

###Terminal


git status

git add .

git commit -m "Added custom contact form path"

git push origin contact_form
