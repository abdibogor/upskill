We'll create a new branch with Git, since it makes sense to add our new contact form feature in it's own separate branch.
Just as we did with our home and about pages, we will add a blank contact form page.
To add pages in Rails, we need to add code to a controller, a view file, and the routes file.
First, we merge our latest code from the pages_and_layout branch into the master branch. Then we create a new branch called contact_form, by branching off of the now-updated master so that contact_form also contains the latest version of our site.

###Terminal


git branch

git checkout master

git merge pages_and_layout

git checkout -b conact_form

Then, we create the files we need to have a blank contact form page.

###Terminal

touch app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb

mkdir app/views/contacts

touch app/views/contacts/new.html.erb

###app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb


class ContactsController < ApplicationController
  
	def new
  
    end

end

###app/views/contacts/new.html.erb


<h1>Contact Form</h1>

###config/routes.rb


...

resources :contacts

...

###Terminal


git add .

git commit -m "Added contact form view, route, controller"

git push origin contact_form
