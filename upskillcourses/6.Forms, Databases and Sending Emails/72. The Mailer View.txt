We need an actual HTML email template to send when our contact form is submitted.

The way we do this in Rails is by creating a corresponding HTML view for the contact_email function that we wrote earlier.

###Terminal


mkdir app/views/contact_mailer

touch app/views/contact_mailer/contact_email.html.erb

###app/views/contact_mailer/contact_email.html.erb
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <
head></head>
  
<body>
    
<p>You have received a message from the site's contact form, from
    <%= "#{ @name }, #{ @email }." %></p>
    
<p><%= @body %></p>
  
</body>

</html>

###Terminal


git status

git add .

git commit -m "Added contact form mailer view"

git push origin contact_form
