Now we can build user profiles for our users.

As programmers, we need to think of profiles as objects - just lists of information related to a user profile.

To save these objects, we need to migrate our database so it has a new profiles table.


###Terminal
git checkout -b user_profiles

rails g migration CreateProfiles

rails db:migrate

git add .

git commit -m "Added profiles table"

git push origin user_profiles
