Nested routes are useful when you want URLs for associated objects, like users and their profiles.
We can map out all of the routes we need for user profiles by adding a simple chunk of code.

###config/routes.rb
...

resources :users do
  
resource :profile

end

...


###Terminal


git add .

git commit -m "Added routes for user profiles"

git push origin user_profiles
