Let's carve out a plan for coding up the profiles.

We need a controller for managing HTTP requests related to profiles.

We'll also add a placeholder view file for the new action and a link to it on the home page.

###Requirements.txt
...

User Profiles

* Each user should have one profile

* User should see link to new profile form upon signing up

* User should be able to create and view their user profile

* User profile should have a profile picture

* User should be able to view all user profiles

###Terminal


touch app/controllers/profiles_controller.rb

###app/controllers/profiles_controller.rb


class ProfilesController < ApplicationController
  
# GET to /users/:user_id/profile/new
 
 def new
    
# Render blank profile details form
  
end

end

###Terminal


mkdir app/views/profiles

touch app/views/profiles/new.html.erb


###app/views/profiles/new.html.erb


touch app/views/profiles/new.html.erb

###app/views/pages/home.html.erb


<%= link_to "Create your profile!", new_user_profile_path(user_id: current_user.id) if user_signed_in? %>

###Terminal
git add .

git commit -m "Added profiles controller, new view, and link on homepage"

git push origin user_profiles
