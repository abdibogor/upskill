Twitter Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com) or bootstrap cdn
We'll cover the importance and benefit of using a CSS and JS framework like Bootstrap.

A best practice for adding Bootstrap to Rails is by adding a gem to our app.

Adding it this way will ensure it is added to our site optimally, in terms of speed and functionality.

###Gemfile


...

# Use Twitter Bootstrap library for front-end UI and layout

gem 'bootstrap-sass', '3.3.7'

...

We renamed our application.css file to application.css.scss

###app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss


@import 'bootstrap-sprockets';

@import 'bootstrap';

###app/views/layouts/application.html.erb


<div class="container">
  
<%= yield %>

</div>
