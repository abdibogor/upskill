Many sites have an About page for describing what a company does.

Here we'll add a page, the Rails way.

###app/controllers/pages_controller.rb


...

def about
end

...

###Terminal


touch app/views/pages/about.html.erb

###app/views/pages/about.html.erb


<h2>About Page</h2>

###config/routes.rb

...
get 'about', to: 'pages#about'
...

###app/views/layouts/application.html.erb


...

<link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,800" rel="stylesheet">

...

###Terminal

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Added about view, route, controller action"
git push origin pages_and_layout
