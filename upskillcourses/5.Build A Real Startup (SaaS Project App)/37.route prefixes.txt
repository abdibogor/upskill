We'll learn an important terminal command called rails routes.

We'll use prefixes instead of hard-coding our links so that our site can scale without breaking as easily, as our pages change over time.

###Terminal


rails routes

(Before Rails 5, you had to use...)

rake routes

###app/views/layouts/application.html.erb


...

<%= link_to root_path, class: "navbar-brand" do %>

...

<li><%= link_to "About", about_path %></li>

###Terminal

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Updated links to use prefixes"
git push origin pages_and_layout
