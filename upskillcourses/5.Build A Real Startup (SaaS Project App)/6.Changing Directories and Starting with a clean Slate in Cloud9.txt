1.We'll learn a few linux commands, which are useful for controlling our Cloud9 virtual computer without using a mouse. Linux is not actually a language - technically speaking, it is a widely distributed family of software developed by Linus Torvalds. In our case Cloud9 is using a version of Linux which enables us to use these commands.
2.We'll delete the default Rails app and create an empty workspace folder.
3.In Cloud9, the Terminal refers to a folder called 'workspace' - this folder is identical to the folder name at the top of your file system.

###Terminal
cd
rm -r workspace
ls
mkdir workspace
cd workspace
clear

If you had trouble deleting the workspace folder, you can also try running the following commands.

###Terminal
cd
rm -rf workspace
mkdir workspace
cd workspace
ls
