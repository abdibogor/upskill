Here, we'll learn how to associate plans and users programmatically.
We create associations to make it easy to connect an object from one class to an object of another class.
We also create the association using a concept called Relational Databases.

###app/models/plan.rb


class Plan < ActiveRecord::Base
  
has_many :users

end

###app/models/user.rb


...

belongs_to :plan

...

###Terminal


rails g migration AddPlanToUser

###db/migrate/xyz_add_plan_to_user.rb


class AddPlanToUser < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  
def change
    
add_column :users, :plan_id, :integer
  
end

end

###Terminal


rails db:migrate
git 
add .

git commit -m "Added association for plans and users"

git push origin user_memberships
