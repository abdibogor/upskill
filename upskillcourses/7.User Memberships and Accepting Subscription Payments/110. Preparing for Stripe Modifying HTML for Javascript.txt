We need to label our Pro form so that our upcoming Javascript code can target that form specifically.
We also need to include the Stripe JS library and our Stripe public key somewhere on the site so that our Javascript can reference them.

###app/views/devise/registrations/_pro_form.html.erb
<%= form_for(resource, as: resource_name, url: registration_path(resource_name), html: {id: 'pro_form'}) do |f| %>
...
<%= f.submit "Sign up", class: 'btn btn-success', id: 'form-submit-btn' %>
...

###app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
...
<%= javascript_include_tag "https://js.stripe.com/v2/", type: 'text/javascript' %>

...

<%= tag :meta, :name => "stripe-key", :content => STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY %>

...
