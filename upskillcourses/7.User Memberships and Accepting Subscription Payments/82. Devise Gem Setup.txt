Git branch

gem install

We'll install a gem called Devise, which gives our site user authentication capabilities.

First, we'll switch to a new branch using Git.

###Terminal


git checkout -b user_memberships

###Gemfile


...

# Use Devise for user authentication
gem 'devise', '4.2.0'

...

###Terminal
bundle install

rails generate devise:install

rails generate devise User

rails db:migrate

(This command used to be rake db:migrate before Rails 5)

rails g devise:views

git add .

git commit -m "Installed devise gem"

(In the video, we push up the master branch, which is fine, but you should actually push up the user_memberships branch using the following command)
git push origin user_memberships
