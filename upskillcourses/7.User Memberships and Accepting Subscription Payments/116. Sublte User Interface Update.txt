Here we add a subtle UI improvement so that users must always pick a membership plan upon signing up.

We can do this by create a function that fires anytime the customer visits a registration form.


###app/controllers/users/registrations_controller.rb
...

before_action :select_plan, only: :new

...

private
  
def select_plan
    
unless (params[:plan] == '1' || params[:plan] == '2')
     
 flash[:notice] = "Please select a membership plan to sign up."
      
redirect_to root_url
    
end
  
end

...

###Terminal


git add .

git commit -m "Added flash notice for selecting membership plan"

git push origin user_memberships
