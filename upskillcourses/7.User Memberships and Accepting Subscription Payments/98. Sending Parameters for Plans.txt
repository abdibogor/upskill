We'll learn a very important technique for sending data through a URL. This is called query string parameters.

By passing data through a URL, we can send data from one page to the next page load.

The 2 ways you can pass information (called parameters) from page to page is either using forms (POST data) or via query string parameters.

###app/controllers/pages_controller.rb
def home
  
	@basic_plan = Plan.find(1)
  
	@pro_plan = Plan.find(2)

end


###app/views/pages/home.html.erb
...

<%= link_to "Sign up with Basic", new_user_registration_path(plan: @basic_plan.id), class: 'btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block' %>

...

<%= link_to "Sign up with Pro", new_user_registration_path(plan: @pro_plan.id), class: 'btn btn-success btn-lg btn-block' %>

...

###app/views/layouts/application.html.erb (remove the following line of code)
<%= link_to "Sign Up", new_user_registration_path, class: 'btn btn-success navbar-btn' %>

###console commands
git add .
git commit -m "Added plan vars and params to home page"
git push origin user_memberships
